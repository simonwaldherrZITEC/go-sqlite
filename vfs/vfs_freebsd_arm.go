// This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
// against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
//
// If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
// to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
// may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
// only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
// is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
// to NULL.
//
// The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
// [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
// The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
// flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
// and not its inode needs to be synced.
//

// xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
// The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
// either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
// PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
// if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
//
// The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
// VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
// [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
// integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
// point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
// write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
// functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
// locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
// about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
// core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
// A [file control opcodes | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
// Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
// greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should

// recognize.

// CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
//
// An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
// the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
// in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".  See
// the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
//
// The VFS interface is sometimes extended by adding new methods onto
// the end.  Each time such an extension occurs, the iVersion field
// is incremented.  The iVersion value started out as 1 in
// SQLite [version 3.5.0] on [dateof:3.5.0], then increased to 2
// with SQLite [version 3.7.0] on [dateof:3.7.0], and then increased
// to 3 with SQLite [version 3.7.6] on [dateof:3.7.6].  Additional fields
// may be appended to the sqlite3_vfs object and the iVersion value
// may increase again in future versions of SQLite.
// Note that due to an oversight, the structure
// of the sqlite3_vfs object changed in the transition from
// SQLite [version 3.5.9] to [version 3.6.0] on [dateof:3.6.0]
// and yet the iVersion field was not increased.
//
// The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
// structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
// a pathname in this VFS.
//
// Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
// the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
// and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
// in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
// searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
// implementation should use the pNext pointer.
//
// The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
// structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
// or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
// The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
// object once the object has been registered.
//
// The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
// be unique across all VFS modules.
//
// [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
// ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
// is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
// from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
// ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
// consist of a single "-" character followed by no more than
// 11 alphanumeric and/or "-" characters.
// ^SQLite further guarantees that
// the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
// called. Because of the previous sentence,
// the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
// filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
// If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
// must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the
// xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
// flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
//
// The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
// the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
// or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
// [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE].
// If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
// include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
//
// ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
// call, depending on the object being opened:
//
// <ul>
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUPER_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
// </ul>)^
//
// The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
// change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
// that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
// the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
// also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
// SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
// file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
// order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
//
// SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
//
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
// </ul>
//
// The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
// deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
// databases, and subjournals.
//
// ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
// with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
// analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
// API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the
// SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
// be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
// It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened
// for exclusive access.
//
// ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
// to hold the [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
// argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
// allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
// the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
// a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
// this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
// element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
// or failure of the xOpen call.
//
// [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]]
// ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
// to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
// test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
// to test whether a file is at least readable.  The SQLITE_ACCESS_READ
// flag is never actually used and is not implemented in the built-in
// VFSes of SQLite.  The file is named by the second argument and can be a
// directory. The xAccess method returns [SQLITE_OK] on success or some
// non-zero error code if there is an I/O error or if the name of
// the file given in the second argument is illegal.  If SQLITE_OK
// is returned, then non-zero or zero is written into *pResOut to indicate
// whether or not the file is accessible.
//
// ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
// output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
// is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
// is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
// handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
// to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
//
// The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
// interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
// included in the VFS structure for completeness.
// The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
// of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
// the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
// The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
// least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
// method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
// a floating point value.
// ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
// Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in

// CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
//
// An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
// the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
// in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".  See
// the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
//
// The VFS interface is sometimes extended by adding new methods onto
// the end.  Each time such an extension occurs, the iVersion field
// is incremented.  The iVersion value started out as 1 in
// SQLite [version 3.5.0] on [dateof:3.5.0], then increased to 2
// with SQLite [version 3.7.0] on [dateof:3.7.0], and then increased
// to 3 with SQLite [version 3.7.6] on [dateof:3.7.6].  Additional fields
// may be appended to the sqlite3_vfs object and the iVersion value
// may increase again in future versions of SQLite.
// Note that due to an oversight, the structure
// of the sqlite3_vfs object changed in the transition from
// SQLite [version 3.5.9] to [version 3.6.0] on [dateof:3.6.0]
// and yet the iVersion field was not increased.
//
// The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
// structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
// a pathname in this VFS.
//
// Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
// the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
// and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
// in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
// searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
// implementation should use the pNext pointer.
//
// The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
// structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
// or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
// The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
// object once the object has been registered.
//
// The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
// be unique across all VFS modules.
//
// [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
// ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
// is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
// from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
// ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
// consist of a single "-" character followed by no more than
// 11 alphanumeric and/or "-" characters.
// ^SQLite further guarantees that
// the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
// called. Because of the previous sentence,
// the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
// filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
// If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
// must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the
// xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
// flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
//
// The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
// the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
// or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
// [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE].
// If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
// include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
//
// ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
// call, depending on the object being opened:
//
// <ul>
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUPER_JOURNAL]
// <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
// </ul>)^
//
// The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
// change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
// that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
// the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
// also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
// SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
// file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
// order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
//
// SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
//
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
// </ul>
//
// The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
// deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
// will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
// databases, and subjournals.
//
// ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
// with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
// analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
// API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the
// SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
// be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
// It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened
// for exclusive access.
//
// ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
// to hold the [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
// argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
// allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
// the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
// a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
// this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
// element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
// or failure of the xOpen call.
//
// [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]]
// ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
// to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
// test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
// to test whether a file is at least readable.  The SQLITE_ACCESS_READ
// flag is never actually used and is not implemented in the built-in
// VFSes of SQLite.  The file is named by the second argument and can be a
// directory. The xAccess method returns [SQLITE_OK] on success or some
// non-zero error code if there is an I/O error or if the name of
// the file given in the second argument is illegal.  If SQLITE_OK
// is returned, then non-zero or zero is written into *pResOut to indicate
// whether or not the file is accessible.
//
// ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
// output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
// is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
// is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
// handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
// to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
//
// The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
// interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
// included in the VFS structure for completeness.
// The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
// of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
// the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
// The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
// least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
// method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
// a floating point value.
// ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
// Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in
// a 24-hour day).
// ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current
// date and time if that method is available (if iVersion is 2 or
// greater and the function pointer is not NULL) and will fall back
// to xCurrentTime() if xCurrentTimeInt64() is unavailable.

// ^Information about the ORDER BY clause is stored in aOrderBy[].
// ^Each term of aOrderBy records a column of the ORDER BY clause.
//
// The colUsed field indicates which columns of the virtual table may be
// required by the current scan. Virtual table columns are numbered from
// zero in the order in which they appear within the CREATE TABLE statement
// passed to sqlite3_declare_vtab(). For the first 63 columns (columns 0-62),

// to the right of the first 63 is required, then bit 63 of colUsed is also

// binary search on a unique indexed field of an SQLite table with N rows.
//
// ^The estimatedRows value is an estimate of the number of rows that
// will be returned by the strategy.
//
// The xBestIndex method may optionally populate the idxFlags field with a
// mask of SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_* flags. Currently there is only one such flag -
// SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE. If the xBestIndex method sets this flag, SQLite
// assumes that the strategy may visit at most one row.
//
// Additionally, if xBestIndex sets the SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE flag, then
// SQLite also assumes that if a call to the xUpdate() method is made as
// part of the same statement to delete or update a virtual table row and the
// implementation returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, then there is no need to rollback
// any database changes. In other words, if the xUpdate() returns
// SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, the database contents must be exactly as they were
// before xUpdate was called. By contrast, if SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE is not

// a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
// extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
// database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
// on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
// ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
// created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
// false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
// does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
// it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
// never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
// ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
// false will always have the "discard" flag set to true.
// ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
// never contain any unpinned pages.
//
// [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
// ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
// suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
// instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
// the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command.)^  As with the bPurgeable
// parameter, the implementation is not required to do anything with this
// value; it is advisory only.
//
// [[the xPagecount() page cache methods]]
// The xPagecount() method must return the number of pages currently
// stored in the cache, both pinned and unpinned.
//
// [[the xFetch() page cache methods]]
// The xFetch() method locates a page in the cache and returns a pointer to
// an sqlite3_pcache_page object associated with that page, or a NULL pointer.
// The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a
// pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a
// single database page.  The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be
// a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested
// for each entry in the page cache.
//
// The page to be fetched is determined by the key. ^The minimum key value
// is 1.  After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page is considered
// to be "pinned".
//
// If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache
// implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content
// intact.  If the requested page is not already in the cache, then the
// cache implementation should use the value of the createFlag
// parameter to help it determined what action to take:
//
// <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
// <tr><th> createFlag <th> Behavior when page is not already in cache
// <tr><td> 0 <td> Do not allocate a new page.  Return NULL.
// <tr><td> 1 <td> Allocate a new page if it easy and convenient to do so.
//                 Otherwise return NULL.
// <tr><td> 2 <td> Make every effort to allocate a new page.  Only return
//                 NULL if allocating a new page is effectively impossible.
// </table>
//
// ^(SQLite will normally invoke xFetch() with a createFlag of 0 or 1.  SQLite
// will only use a createFlag of 2 after a prior call with a createFlag of 1
// failed.)^  In between the xFetch() calls, SQLite may
// attempt to unpin one or more cache pages by spilling the content of
// pinned pages to disk and synching the operating system disk cache.
//
// [[the xUnpin() page cache method]]
// ^xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
// as its second argument.  If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
// then the page must be evicted from the cache.
// ^If the discard parameter is
// zero, then the page may be discarded or retained at the discretion of
// page cache implementation. ^The page cache implementation
// may choose to evict unpinned pages at any time.
//
// The cache must not perform any reference counting. A single
// call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls
// to xFetch().
//
// [[the xRekey() page cache methods]]
// The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
// page passed as the second argument. If the cache
// previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be
// discarded. ^Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
// to be pinned.
//
// When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
// existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
// to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
// of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
// they can be safely discarded.
//
// [[the xDestroy() page cache method]]
// ^The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
// All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. ^After
// calling the xDestroy() method, SQLite considers the [sqlite3_pcache*]
// handle invalid, and will not use it with any other sqlite3_pcache_methods2
// functions.
//
// [[the xShrink() page cache method]]
// ^SQLite invokes the xShrink() method when it wants the page cache to
// free up as much of heap memory as possible.  The page cache implementation
// is not obligated to free any memory, but well-behaved implementations should
// do their best.

// the ones FreeBSD traditionally used based on our reading of the POSIX
// standards. However, glibc uses 199309 for all of them, even those many were
// not defined there. To remain bug compatible with glibc means more software
// that relied on the glibc behavior will compile easily on FreeBSD.
//
// Also, CLOCK_UPTIME_FAST is improperly visible temporarily for the lang/pocl

// Decimal<->sbt conversions.  Multiplying or dividing by SBT_1NS results in
// large roundoff errors which sbttons() and nstosbt() avoid.  Millisecond and
// microsecond functions are also provided for completeness.
//
// These functions return the smallest sbt larger or equal to the
// number of seconds requested so that sbttoX(Xtosbt(y)) == y.  Unlike
// top of second computations below, which require that we tick at the
// top of second, these need to be rounded up so we do whatever for at
// least as long as requested.
//
// The naive computation we'd do is this
//	((unit * 2^64 / SIFACTOR) + 2^32-1) >> 32
// However, that overflows. Instead, we compute
//	((unit * 2^63 / SIFACTOR) + 2^31-1) >> 32

// term to ensure we are using exactly the right constant. We use the lesser
// evil of ull rather than a uint64_t cast to ensure we have well defined
// right shift semantics. With these changes, we get all the ns, us and ms
// conversions back and forth right.
// Note: This file is used for both kernel and userland includes, so we can't
// rely on KASSERT being defined, nor can we pollute the namespace by including

// File status flags: these are used by open(2), fcntl(2).
// They are also used (indirectly) in the kernel file structure f_flags,
// which is a superset of the open/fcntl flags.  Open flags and f_flags
// are inter-convertible using OFLAGS(fflags) and FFLAGS(oflags).
// Open/fcntl flags begin with O_; kernel-internal flags begin with F.
// open-only flags

// Kernel encoding of open mode; separate read and write bits that are
// independently testable: 1 greater than the above.

// FREAD and FWRITE are excluded from the #ifdef _KERNEL so that TIOCFLUSH,

// The O_* flags used to have only F* names, which were used in the kernel
// and by fcntl.  We retain the F* names for the kernel f_flag field
// and for backward compatibility for fcntl.  These flags are deprecated.

// Historically, we ran out of bits in f_flag (which was once a short).
// However, the flag bits not set in FMASK are only meaningful in the
// initial open syscall.  Those bits were thus given a
// different meaning for fcntl(2).

// __FreeBSD_version numbers are documented in the Porter's Handbook.
// If you bump the version for any reason, you should update the documentation
// there.
// Currently this lives here in the doc/ repository:
//
//	documentation/content/en/books/porters-handbook/versions/_index.adoc
//
// scheme is:  <major><two digit minor>Rxx
//		'R' is in the range 0 to 4 if this is a release branch or
//		X.0-CURRENT before releng/X.0 is created, otherwise 'R' is
//		in the range 5 to 9.

// __FreeBSD_kernel__ indicates that this system uses the kernel of FreeBSD,
// which by definition is always true on FreeBSD. This macro is also defined
// on other systems that use the kernel of FreeBSD, such as GNU/kFreeBSD.
//
// It is tempting to use this macro in userland code when we want to enable
// kernel-specific routines, and in fact it's fine to do this in code that
// is part of FreeBSD itself.  However, be aware that as presence of this
// macro is still not widespread (e.g. older FreeBSD versions, 3rd party
// compilers, etc), it is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED to check for this macro in
// external applications without also checking for __FreeBSD__ as an
// alternative.

// According to ANSI (section 2.2.4.2), the values below must be usable by
// #if preprocessing directives.  Additionally, the expression must have the
// same type as would an expression that is an object of the corresponding
// type converted according to the integral promotions.  The subtraction for
// INT_MIN, etc., is so the value is not unsigned; e.g., 0x80000000 is an
// unsigned int for 32-bit two's complement ANSI compilers (section 3.1.3.2).

// max value for an unsigned long long

// Quads and long longs are the same size.  Ensure they stay in sync.
